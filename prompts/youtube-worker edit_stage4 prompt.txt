Stage 4 – YouTube worker uses presigned URLs

We’ve finished Stage 3 (db1 /db1/videos/get-presigned is live and tested).
Now update youtube-worker to:

Claim jobs from /db1/publishing/claim with channel_key:"youtube".

For each job, call /db1/videos/get-presigned (internal bearer) to get r2presigned.

Upload to YouTube via resumable upload, streaming bytes from r2presigned.

Patch /db1/publishing/update as it progresses:

On start: status:"scheduling".

On success: status:"scheduled" (if future publishAt) or status:"posted" (immediate), set platform_media_id, platform_url, posted_at if applicable, clear last_error, bump retry_count.

On fail: status:"error", set last_error, bump retry_count.

Don’t log tokens or presigned URLs. Optional VERBOSE_YT console debug only.

Deliver:

Surgical code patches only for youtube-worker (no refactors elsewhere).

Tiny test plan (PowerShell/curl) to prove: claim → presign → upload → patch.

Exact request/response shapes you use for the three DB1 routes + YouTube (token + upload).

10-line README delta for env vars/flags.

Keep it concise and copy/paste-ready.
